    <p>
    The first step in gaining access to MGHPCC-SS resources is creating a MGHPCC-SS account.
    MGHPCC-SS accounts link your institutional identity (e.g. your university login) with
    a MGHPCC-SS identity that is used to make access decisions when you use MGHPCC-SS
    resources.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you have a MGHPCC-SS account, MGHPCC-SS resource owners will be able to grant you access
    to resources that they control. The steps to create a MGHPCC-SS account are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit the MGHPCC-SS Registration Page (link at bottom of this page)
        <li>You will be redirected to a logon page where you will select your university
        <li>You will logon with your university credentials
        <li> After successful logon, your browser will redirect back to the
        MGHPCC-SS Registration Page to complete the account creation process.
        <li>When done, you will have linked your university ID with your MGHPCC-SS account.
        You will use your university logon to access MGHPCC-SS resources.
    </ol>
    <h2>Multiple University Credentials</h2>
    <p>
    You can only link one university account to a MGHPCC-SS account; if you have multiple university accounts you will
    only be able to link one of those accounts to your MGHPCC-SS account. If at a later date you
    want to change which account is connected to your MGHPCC-SS identity you can by contacting
    <a href = "mailto: {{ EMAIL_MSS_SUPPORT }}">{{ EMAIL_MSS_SUPPORT }}</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>No Institutional Credentials or Institution not Known to InCommon</h2>
    <p>
    Some users do not have institutional credentials or their institution is not on the <a href=#>list of institutions
    in the InCommon federation</a>. In those cases, users can link from one of the following commercial identity providers (all of
    the listed providers have free account creation):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google
        <li>GitHub
    </ul>

    <p class='pl-2'>
        <em>
        Note that, if you have an institutional identity, it's preferrable that you use that identity to create your MGHPCC-SS account.
        Institutional identities are vetted by identity management teams and provide a higher level of confidence to resource owners
        when granting access to resources.
        </em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Clicking the link below will initiate the account creation process. You will be redirected to a site managed by
    <a href="https://www.cilogon.org/faq">CILogon</a>
    where you will select your institutional or commercial identity provider. Once selected, you will be redirected
    to your institutional or commercial identity provider where you will login. At the completion of that logon, your
    browser will be redirected to the MGHPCC-SS Account Management site where you will complete your MGHPCC-SS account creation process.
